In a world where people never make friends, two unexpected heroes decide to not be silly anti-social individuals and start having a normal conversation. Our two heroes will discover that talking to others is not a bad thing. They will learn more about themselves such as what other people's favorite color is... and if it is the same as their own! Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson star as two friends in FRIENDS!

- Other nice guy who just sorta follows along with the first saying "WAOW" about everything: Owen Wilson
- Generic love interest: Megan Fox
- Not nice person who needs to be shown the power of friendship: Samuel Jackson
